Line Up Game in Java

A new interpetion of an old card game I had on my first PC a very old Amstrad back in the yonder of Dos! 

Unfortunitly it always crashed when you completed it but mine doesn't!

Simple Swing Gui, and SQL DAO linked High Score DB

Download, unzip, run: http://www.filebox.com/z0aydih0wt0d

Update: Code adjusted so the jdbc driver is now in the program files folder. 
This jar is not uploaded to github so will need to be sourced if clonong the repo.
